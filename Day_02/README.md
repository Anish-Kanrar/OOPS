# Java Programming Questions [31 July 2024]

1. **Write a program in Java to create a class Student with data members `name`, `city`, and `age` along with the
   method `setData()` to set the values and `printData()` to display the data.**

2. **Define a Student class (`roll`: integer, `number`: string, `marks`: float). Define parameterized setter method to
   set the student data members and display method to print student details. Instantiate a student object using
   parameterized setter method and use display method to print the details of the student.**

3. **Write a program in Java to create a class Animal having a method `eat()` to print the message "all Animal can eat".
   From this Animal class create a child class of name Dog. Dog has its own member method called `bark()` to print the
   message "Dogs are barking". Now create an object of Dog to print its eating and barking nature.**

4. **Write a program to design a class AreaCalculation and then find out the area (using method overloading) of a circle
   whose radius is 7cm, area of rectangle whose length is 4.5cm and breadth is 4cm and also the area of cuboid whose
   length, breadth & height are 3cm, 2cm & 4cm respectively.**

5. **Define a Student class (`roll`: integer, `number`: string, `marks`: float). Define no-argument and parameterized
   getter methods for initializing student object. Create two student objects. One object is initialized using
   parameterized getter method and second one is initialized using no-argument getter methods. Also print the contents
   of each object using `display()` method. (Use of method overloading)**
